//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
let movies = ['Godfather', 'Godfather II', 'Godfather III'];
//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
let movie1 = movies[0];
//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
let arrayLength = movies.length;
//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?
let lastMovie = movies[arrayLength - 1];
